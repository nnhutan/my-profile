I studied at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology and graduated in 2023 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I began my journey as a backend developer in 2022 and have since transitioned to a full-stack developer. I have experience with Ruby on Rails, React the most because I have been working with them for a long time. I always try to learn new things and improve my skills every day.
